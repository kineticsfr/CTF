# Obedient Cat - picoCTF 2021
This file has a flag in plain sight (aka "in-the-clear"). 
## General Skills - 5 Points - Hints: 3
Going into this challenge the title already gives away that I might be using the "cat" command to print out the file contents.
Looking in the description it becomes even more clear.

I download the file and run cat against the file, and voila we got the flag "picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_2aa22101}"
